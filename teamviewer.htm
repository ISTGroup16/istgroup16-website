<h1>Remote Access: Team Viewer Software</h1>

<h2> What is Team Viewer?</h2>
<p> Team Viewer is an all-in-one solution for remote support, remote access, and online meetings. In 2005, a small company based in Southern Germany invented
this software to connect to their customers' computers and showcase new applications remotely. The software allows for effective communication at any time,
and is perfect for online meetings as there is quick and easy exchange.</p>
<p> Today, Team Viewer helps around 630,000 customers worldwide and from all industries to digitalize their business-critical processes. The companies using
this software are most often found in the United States and in the Information Technology and Services industry. They often have an average of one million
dollars in revenue. The British Petroleum Company p.l.c is an example of a company that uses Team Viewer software. It is a multinational oil, gas and 
chemicals organisation that is based in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p> To add on, Team Viewer connects users from anywhere in the world, with whatever device they are using. The software is compatible with the following
types of devices: Androids, iOS, mobile, tablet, desktop, and laptop. On this page, you will learn how to set up your devices as well as how to connect to
remote devices and users.</p>

<h2>How Can One Use Team Viewer?</h2>
